# NOVALUX — Luxury Real Estate Web Application

An ultra-luxury real estate web application inspired by the modern, minimalist aesthetics of high-end Framer templates (like Novalux). Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, and modern micro-interactions.

## 1. Design System & Visual Identity

### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: Obsidian Dark (`#0A0B0D`) with Off-White / Warm Cream (`#FAFAFA`) for high-contrast thematic contrast sections.
- **Accent & Primary CTAs**: Warm Bronze / Brushed Gold (`#C5A059` and `#D4AF37`) paired with Deep Charcoal (`#1A1C20`).
- **Surface Cards**: Glassmorphic and elevated surfaces (`#14161A` with 1px border `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`).
- **Typography Colors**: Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) for primary headings, Muted Silver (`#94A3B8`) for body/secondary text, and Dark Charcoal (`#111827`) on light sections.

### Typography
- **Headings & Display**: Serif display fonts (*Cormorant Garamond* & *Playfair Display*) with tight tracking (`-0.02em` / `-0.03em`) and sophisticated luxury weight.
- **Body & UI Text**: *Plus Jakarta Sans* / *Inter* for optimal legibility at 14px–16px with 1.6 line-height.

### Micro-Interactions & Styling
- **Border Radius**: Modern subtle curves (`8px` for media cards, `24px` for container sections, pills/capsules for tags).
- **Subtle Inner Borders**: 1px translucent borders (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`) instead of heavy outer drop shadows.
- **Animations**: Ambient photographic transitions, subtle scale-up on hover (`1.02x transform`), slide-up actions, and toast feedback.

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ or v20+)
- npm

### Installation & Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```
The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

### Deploying to Vercel

Import this repository into Vercel with the repository root as the Root Directory.
The tracked `vercel.json` selects the Vite framework, runs `npm run build`, and
publishes `dist`. Use `npm ci` if setting an explicit Install Command.

This app uses client-side routing: React selects the page from the browser URL.
The rewrite in `vercel.json` serves `index.html` for page URLs such as
`/agents/james-carter`, allowing direct visits and refreshes to reach React instead
of returning a Vercel 404. Existing static assets continue to be served normally.

After deploying, verify the home page, open `/agents/james-carter` directly,
refresh it, and open a profile from both the home page and `/agents` directory.
The same rewrite also supports property and blog detail URLs.
